# GOTO Transcoder

This project is still in early development stages. The goal here is to have a tool that facilitates visualizing and changing GOTO programs generated from ESBMC and CBMC by:
- Parsing the GBF (goto binary format?) from ESBMC and CBMC
- Writing into GBF to ESBMC/CBMC. Allowing to convert between both versions.

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/esbmc/goto-transcoder/wiki/Steps-to-verify-Rust-code) for use examples.
